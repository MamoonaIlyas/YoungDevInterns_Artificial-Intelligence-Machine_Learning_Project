# YoungDevInterns_Artificial-Intelligence-Machine_Learning_Project
As part of my AI & ML Internship at YoungDev, I worked on a classification project using the Cereal Nutrition Dataset to predict cereal ratings categorized as Low, Medium, and High.

âœ… I implemented both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches:

Built a Logistic Regression classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, optimizing for F1-macro score.

Developed a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DNN) using Keras, integrating regularization techniques like Dropout and Batch Normalization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

Achieved improved performance with the DNN, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in structured data classification tasks.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation was performed using accuracy metrics and classification reports, highlighting model strengths across all rating categories.

This task deepened my understanding of model optimization, regularization techniques, and practical deployment of ML pipelines.
